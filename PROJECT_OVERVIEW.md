## Best Practices for LARP Events

### Before Event
1. Test on actual devices
2. Verify WiFi/network connectivity (for multi-tab sync)
3. Pre-load all rooms and ghost images
4. Decide if sanity system should be enabled
5. Brief players on interface usage

### During Event
1. Ghost player selects room and type first
2. Investigators start with neutral evidence
3. Ghost triggers interactions strategically
4. Switchboard operator creates atmosphere
5. Monitor sanity levels (if enabled)

### After Event
1. Review activity log for highlights
2. Note any technical issues
3. Gather player feedback
4. Clear state for next session (refresh page)

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Images not loading
- Check `/assets/` folder structure
- Verify image paths match exactly
- Check browser console for 404 errors

**Issue**: State not syncing between devices
- Ensure localStorage is enabled
- Check if devices are on same network (not required but helpful for multi-device setup)
- Verify 500ms sync interval is running

**Issue**: Cooldowns not working
- Check if sanity system is enabled
- Verify cooldown logic in triggerInteraction() and toggleHunt()
- Check browser console for errors

**Issue**: Polaroids not flipping
- Verify CSS 3D transforms are supported
- Check browser compatibility
- Test in Chrome/Edge for best support
